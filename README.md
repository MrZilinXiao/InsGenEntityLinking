# InsGenEntityLinking
Official Implementation of the EMNLP 2023 paper on "Instructed Language Models with Retriever Are Powerful Entity Linkers". Code, checkpoints and documents are being organized and kept being updated.

## Environment
During the time of development, the implementation of LLaMA in `transformers` is not stable, so we provided an adapted version in this repo. Be sure to uninstall the local `transformers` package before running the code, running it in a clean environment or changing the order of `PYTHONPATH` so that local packages have higher priority than the installed ones.
